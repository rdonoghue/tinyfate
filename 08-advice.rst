Advice to GMs
*************

* Offer a bargain whenever possible.
  It gets you fate points, and also pushes the game in fun directions.
* Failure should never stop play.
  Failure should merely push play in a new direction.
* Do not make players roll for anything unless you have a firm idea of how both success and failure might move the game forward.
* Be prepared for players to go in unexpected directions with success.
  Roll with it.
