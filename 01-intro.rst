**THIS IS A DRAFT.
IT’S STILL A LIVING DOCUMENT BEING DEVELOPED IN THE OPEN.**

TinyFate is a very small version of the Fate roleplaying game.
Find out more at www.faterpg.com.
Familiarity with other RPGs will be necessary if you intend to run the game, but, if you just wish to play, then all the rules you need are here.

Draft version 0.5 posted August 2018 by Rob Donoghue.

Also available in (very basic) `epub <TinyFate05.epub>`_.

For the Fate Nerds
==================
If you’re new to Fate, I’d suggest skipping ahead to the next section.
If you’re familiar with Fate in any of its many forms, this may seem like a weird document.
It’s not merely a minimalist presentation of Fate, rather it’s an attempt to talk about the game a little bit differently.
Most noticeable, I’m trying to make the language a little bit closer to board game instructions, focusing on procedure.
To that end, I avoid Fate terminology in a few places where you might expect it.
I do not yet know if this is a good or bad thing, but I look forward to finding out.
