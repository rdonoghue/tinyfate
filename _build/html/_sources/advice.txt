Advice to GMs
*************

Offer a bargain whenever possible. It gets you fate points, and also pushes the game in fun directions.
Failure should never stop play. Failure should merely push play in a new direction.
Do not make players roll for anything unless you have a firm idea of how both success and failure might move the game forward.
Be prepared for players to go in unexpected directions with success. Roll with it.
