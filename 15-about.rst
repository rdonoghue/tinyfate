About this game
***************

The original version of TinyFate was `written to my blog <http://walkingmind.evilhat.com>`_, and is expanded here.
The inspiration to write it up more fully was born out of `a fantastic post at the Step into RPGs blog <https://stepintorpgs.wordpress.com>`_.

This game was developed largely in the open, on my blog and on Google Docs, and has been vastly improved by feedback from  many people, including:

* Stephen Morffew
* Michael McCully
* Bruno Bord
* Jim Dagg
* Kirby Gehman
* Dan Kaiser
* Jonathan Hobbs
* Michael McCully
* Nicolas Gilardi
* Sean Dunstan
* Terence Leong
* Robert Wiesehan
* Timo L

(If you gave feedback and I missed your name, ping me!)

Purpose
=======
I describe this as an experiment for a number of reasons.
The largest is that the very first draft of TinyFate fit on a pair of index cards, and that was genuinely all I felt I needed to make it work.
This version is much longer because it’s been an exercise in unpacking **all** of my assumptions.
Turns out there are a lot of them.
It also has been an opportunity to try a variety of publishing technologies.
This iteration used `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, which I find pretty neat, and which I think may be useful for some future collaboration.

License and Stuff
=================
This is still a work in progress, but the expectation is that this will be released under Fate Compatible licenses once it’s complete.
In the interim, I have been using it to experiment with various publishing tools and techniques, most currently building with Sphinx via `this GitHub repo <https://github.com/rdonoghue/tinyfate>`_.

0.5.1

Version Notes
=============
* 0.5.1 - Minor edits for grammar and formatting.
* 0.5.0 - Unpacked a lot of detail around conflict resolution and brought in all my various out of sync text files.
  I’m a little worried that the flow is now a little screwed up, but I’m unifying on a canonical version so I can actually fix it rather than just let it sit idle.
* 0.4.03 - Less about substantive changes and more about me remembering how to use Sphinx.
* Earlier versions - Did not occur to me to track them. Oops.
